## How I use this repository

I keep track of how I use this repository over time as I hope to automate most of it eventually 😂

A show usually starts out with an idea on twitter, such as [the idea to audit repository access using GitHub Actions](https://mobile.twitter.com/jeffwilcox/status/1385711936541663233). If we agree to make a show about it, I turn it into an issue with a `🏷 show` label such as [📅 4/29 @ 1pm PT - GitHub Enterprise repository auditing with @jeffwilcox](https://github.com/gr2m/helpdesk/issues/1). If the idea needs some more research, I turn it into an an issue with an `🏷 idea` label such as [💡 How to use Environments + Secrets](https://github.com/gr2m/helpdesk/issues/6).

I add all `🏷 show` issues to this README as well as on https://github.com/gr2m/gr2m.

I use the issue head of a show for preparation, to make sure the guests (if any) and I are on the same page, and to have a rough outline of steps I want to go through during the show. I try to keep the shows to 30 minutes and getting stuck in an unforeseen problem could blow that time limit very quickly, so I like to be prepared. I invite everyone interested in the show to subscribe to the issue.

When the show goes live, I add a comment with a link to [twitch.tv/gregorcodes](https://www.twitch.tv/gregorcodes), and also send a tweet that the show is going live shortly.

After the show I add a comment to the Twitch recording for people who missed the live show. I also add notes from the show.

Then I upload the recording to YouTube and add another comment with a link to the video on YouTube, as this one won't be removed after 14 days.

After that, I close the issue, and move the show to the "Past" section in this README as well as on https://github.com/gr2m/gr2m

## Progress on automating this repository

My goal is to automate everything about my helpdesk show that can be automated. You can find a list of past and upcoming shows about automating helpdesk at https://github.com/gr2m/helpdesk/issues?q=label%3A%22automating+helpdesk%22

- [x] automate "Upcoming shows" / "Past shows" sections in the repository README — [#10](https://github.com/gr2m/helpdesk/issues/10)
- [x] automate "Upcoming shows" / "Past shows" sections on [my profile page](https://github.com/gr2m/) — [#10](https://github.com/gr2m/helpdesk/issues/10)
- [ ] add a comment when I go live on twitch
- [ ] Send out tweet when I go live on twitch
- [ ] Send out tweet in the morning before a live show
- [ ] add comment with a link to the twitch recording once it's available
- [ ] add a comment with a link to the video on YouTube once it's available in maximal resolution
- [ ] figure out a way to populate show notes from twitch comments
